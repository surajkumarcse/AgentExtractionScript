# AgentExtractionScript

This is the repository made to extract Agent list from the given website. It is extracting the JSON file of agents.

This contains Five files:

  1. test.txt -> Here all the raw city names provided.
  2. processedCity.txt -> Here the whitespaces are removed with the '%20'.
  3. citySpaceChange.cpp -> This C++ file used to convert raw city name from test.txt to the processed one in processedCity.txt
  4. automateAgent.sh -> Bash shell script to access the website and store the content in 'addAgent.json'.
  5. addAgent.json -> This is final result of the agent list in json format.
  
  It is a task given by the company where I am working as an Intern. 

Thanks,
